# virtual-aquarium
A simple JavaScript animation of some <a href="http://susieboyland.com/virtualaquarium/">swimming fish</a>, which is essentially an add-on to/more complicated version of my <a href="http://susieboyland.com/swimmingwhale/" target="_blank">swimming whale animation.</a>
<br><br>Ultimately, the goal is to have multiple fish swimming across the page. In its current stage you can select your fish type from 4 options but it will replace the previous fish rather than adding a new one.
<br><br>The images used in this animation are from <a href="https://openclipart.org" target="_blank">OpenClipart.org</a>:
<ul>
  <li><a href="https://openclipart.org/detail/277787/cartoon-fish" target="_blank">cartoon-fish</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://openclipart.org/detail/122389/angel-fish" target="_blank">angel-fish</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://openclipart.org/detail/172295/clown-fish" target="_blank">clown-fish</a></li>
  <li><a href="https://openclipart.org/detail/2707/happy-fish" target="_blank">happy-fish</a></li>
</ul>
</a>The images can be easy replaced with any other image (as long as it's small enough to fit on the page and have room to move) to create a custom animation for your webpage. The motion of the image will adjust automatically based on the image's width and height.
